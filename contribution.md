# 🤝 Contributing to Shellcode Tester Pro

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Shellcode Tester Pro**!  
This is an open-source tool designed to safely analyze, emulate, and reverse engineer shellcodes using a graphical interface built in Python.

We welcome **feature suggestions**, **bug fixes**, **new plugins**, and **documentation improvements**!

## 📦 Plugin Contributions

Shellcode Tester Pro supports a **plugin system** to extend its functionality.  
You can easily create and share your own plugins. Follow these simple steps:

### 🔧 Plugin Structure

- Create a Python file in the `plugins/` folder.
- Your plugin must contain a `register(app)` function.
- Inside `register()`, you can add tabs, buttons, or hooks to the existing GUI.
  
**Example:**
```python
def register(app):
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QWidget, QLabel, QVBoxLayout
    tab = QWidget()
    layout = QVBoxLayout()
    layout.addWidget(QLabel("Hello from my plugin!"))
    tab.setLayout(layout)
    app.tabs.addTab(tab, "MyPlugin")
```

📝 **Name your file** clearly (e.g., `my_plugin.py`) and test before submitting.
